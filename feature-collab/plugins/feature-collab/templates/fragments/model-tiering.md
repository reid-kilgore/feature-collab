## Model Usage

- Use Opus for the main thread (planning, user interaction, synthesis)
- **Read the agent's frontmatter `model:` field** before dispatching — it specifies the correct model. Do not default to the orchestrator's model tier.
- Never use Opus for agents that just run commands or read files

**Agent model table** — match the task, not the agent name:

| Task | Model | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| Read/find/trace/list code | Haiku | code-explorer (concept tracing), test-runner, commit agent |
| Implement/refactor/debug | Sonnet | code-architect, test-implementer, systematic-debug |
| Plan/synthesize/assess | Opus | criteria-assessor, retro-synthesizer, architecture selection |
| CI monitoring | Haiku | gh-checks agent (single agent with poll loop, NOT sleep+check background tasks) |
